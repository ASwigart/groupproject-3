NU Bootcamp Group Project 3
Proposal:

	Our group would like to pursue a project focused on the United States immigration crisis.  /
  We feel data visualizations would help articulate the scale of the problem to our audience. /
  We would find datasets with the Department of Homeland Security, USCIS (Citizenship and Immigration Services), and Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE).   
	Our end goal project would have a dashboard with a dropdown menu where users would select a country and see the number of refugees arriving in the US over time. /
  We would like to have a heat map of countries with the volume of refugees accepted. A bar chart to show arrivals over time. /
