As humanitarian crises around <br> the world grew, a ceiling of 110,000 refugees was set under President Obama. Throughout his presidency, President Trump <br> continued to lower the cap until it was its absolute lowest at 15,000 in fiscal year 2021.</h4>

                <p>The refugee program has two contributors. First, there are refugees, essentially displaced individuals and families, typically in camps in a third country. There they apply for refugee status in the United States and wait until they are accepted. The second contributor of asylum is an individual with one visa status, asking for asylum inside the borders of the United States. They can ask for asylum “Affirmatively” at a US border point of entry and can demonstrate they are a protected class. Or, once they are in deportation status, they can ask for asylum as a defense to deportation; this is known as a ” Defensive Asylum Seeker”.</p>
